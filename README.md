# FileQuerier üìÇüîçüõ†Ô∏è

FileQuerier is an innovative Rust project designed to revolutionize the way you interact with Excel and CSV files. By leveraging the power of an in-memory SQLite database, FileQuerier allows you to query these files using SQL language, making data manipulation and analysis as seamless as never before. Our vision extends beyond traditional database usage; we aim to introduce a scripting implementation that enables these operations without any database dependency. Join us in shaping the future of file querying!

## Features

- **Load Excel & CSV Files into SQLite**: Import your data seamlessly into an in-memory database for fast and efficient querying.
- **SQL Query Execution**: Utilize the full power of SQL language to query your data without the hassle of database setup.
- **Future Scripting Implementation**: We're working on a scripting feature to query data without any database, making FileQuerier even more versatile.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you dive into FileQuerier, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, visit [Rust's official installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to get started.

### Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cittaz/filequerier.git
cd filequerier
cargo build --release
```

### Usage

To start querying your Excel or CSV files, simply follow these steps:

```bash
# TODO
cargo run -- your-file-path.xlsx "SELECT * FROM your_sheet"
```

Replace `your-file-path.xlsx` with the path to your Excel/CSV file and `your_sheet` with the appropriate sheet name or CSV indicator.
